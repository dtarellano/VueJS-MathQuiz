# vue-cli

> This is a VueJs project given to me by an Instructor.  This App is to show my skills with Animations and Transitions.  The App will generate a simple math question with 4 multiple choice answers. Answers will be clickable and will tell you if you answer was correct or not. If correct it will ask if you wish to continue and will randomly generate a new question.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
